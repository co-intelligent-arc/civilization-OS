A framework for a civilization-scale decision-making OS, built on the  Human-Twin DCM (HT-DCM), Network DCM (N-DCM), and Civilizational  Self-Model (CSM). This repository includes core theory, metrics,  simulation models, and policy interfaces for implementing stable  societal decision-making architectures.
