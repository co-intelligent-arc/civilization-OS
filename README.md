Civilization OS

— Decision-Making Accidents in Intelligent Civilizations

This repository documents an attempt to treat civilizational decision-making
as an engineering problem rather than a moral one.

What is this?

Civilization OS is a research artifact that explores why highly intelligent societies still cause catastrophic decision-making accidents.

This project treats large-scale decision failure not as:

a lack of ethics,

a lack of intelligence,

or malicious intent,

but as a structural accident produced by “correct” decisions made in isolation.

Why does this exist?

Modern civilizations optimize faster than they can reflect.

Individually rational decisions accumulate into:

policy lock-in

institutional rigidity

narrative collapse

and irreversible historical errors

No single actor is “wrong”.
The architecture itself is.

Civilization OS asks a simple question:

What if civilizations need an operating system —
not to decide correctly,
but to avoid becoming unrecoverable?

Core Architecture

Civilization OS consists of three interacting layers:

HT-DCM — Human-Twin Decision Core Model

A dual-core decision structure at the individual scale, separating:

exploration (Hepta Core)

and non-generative supervision (Tetra Core)

Designed to prevent overconfidence, narrative closure, and self-justifying bias.

N-DCM — Network Decision Core Model

A network-scale decision architecture that prevents:

runaway consensus,

silent coordination collapse,

and short-term optimization traps.

CSM — Civilizational Self-Model

A non-decisional modeling layer that externalizes:

historical memory,

long-term risk,

value divergence.

CSM constrains decisions without making them.

This repository values traceable failure over narrative cleanliness.

What this is NOT

❌ Not a political proposal

❌ Not an AI control doctrine

❌ Not a finished system

This is an incomplete architecture by design.

Stability is achieved not by perfect decisions,
but by structures that fail without becoming history.

Status

This project is intentionally published early.

No endorsement is requested.
No consensus is expected.

Read it or ignore it —
but do not assume civilization is stable by default.
